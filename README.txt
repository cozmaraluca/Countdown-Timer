#Countdown-Timer
This project is a countdown timer. 
The user can select a date and an event type using the date picker and event input elements. 
When the user clicks the “OK” button, the input date is checked to ensure that it is not empty and has not already passed. 
If the input date is valid, the countdown timer is displayed and begins counting down to the selected date.
JavaScript is used to create the countdown timer. 
Also DOM manipulation is used to get elements from the page and update their content and visibility. 
The event listeners handle user input and update the page accordingly.
